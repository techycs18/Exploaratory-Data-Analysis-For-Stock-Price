- In this data project we will focus on exploratory data analysis of stock prices. 
- Keep in mind, this project is just meant to practice your visualization and pandas skills, it is not meant to be a robust financial analysis or be taken as financial advice.
- We'll focus on bank stocks and see how they progressed throughout the financial crisis all the way to early 2016.
- The Python libraries we will be using are Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy and Seaborn
